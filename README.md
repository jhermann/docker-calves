## Contributing

Contributing to this project is easy, and reporting an issue or
adding to the documentation also improves things for every user.
You donâ€™t need to be a developer to contribute.
See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jhermann/dockyard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.

As a documentation author or developer,
to **create a working directory** for this project,
call these commands:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/jhermann/dockyard.git"
cd "dockyard"
command . .env --yes
invoke docs -b
```

For this to work, you might also need to follow some
[setup procedures](https://py-generic-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html#quick-setup)
to make the necessary basic commands available on *Linux*, *Mac OS X*, and *Windows*.

To **start a watchdog that auto-rebuilds documentation** and reloads the opened browser tab on any change,
call ``invoke docs -w -b`` (stop the watchdog using the ``-k`` option).
