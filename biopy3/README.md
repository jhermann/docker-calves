# Python3 Base Images Using Ubuntu Bionic

These images are experiments with final image size vs. contained features
and Python version, and also demonstrate various Dockerfile ‘tricks’ to keep
build times short and images small.

See the [main documentation](https://dockyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python-images.html#biopy3)
for details.
